# jonnrb_bazel_ffmpeg

Builds ffmpeg (the libraries and the binary) through
[bazel](https://bazel.build/).

*Note:* Currently, this only works on my MacBook, but I want to see how much
of this I can get working.

## Setup

FFmpeg's configure script does a lot of stuff that I don't want to rip out
into Skylark right now. I'm using the data generated by configure to figure
out the right sources to compile. This data must be generated before you build.
To generate it, run

```bash
./make_converter/gen.sh
```
